# Word-Guess-Game

Welcome to the Word Guess Game - Chemistry Edition! The goal of the game is to guess the correct letters to uncover the hidden word! There are 118 elements [as of May 2019] and the game will randomly choose one for the hidden word. You only have 12 incorrect tries and once you run out, you lose! The game will reveal the element and then reset with a new random word and you may play again.

Here is a deployed link to a live game: https://esarnb.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

## Getting Started

In order to run locally, you must download the css folder with the reset and styling, the images web folder for the background, the javascript folder for the game logic, and the index.html which may be opened in your preferred browser to start playing! (You do not need to download the git images folder.)

### Prerequisites

If you would like to host this game on your own website, you will need to first install a web server, such as [Apache2 for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-16-04)

### Installing

Once your webserver is ready, you may insert the folders + index.html into the root html or in a subfolder. And that is all! Visit your website with the correct subfolder directory where the game is held to play!
